# Contact-Book-App-Management-System-

This simple project is basically based on contact book management system which I prepared using C++. In this project there is a basic concept of file management system. There is a fstream library introduced here to store the data which I give in the projet to see everything like email id, contact number, first name, last name. It will help when we want to search any contact from the search option.  

This is a group based project which I prepared for my Programming in C++ course. My faculty name is Abdullah Mohammad Sakib. We prepared this for any kind of contact managemenet system.
